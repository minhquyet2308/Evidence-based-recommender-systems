# Evidence-based-recommender-systems
The implementation of the evidence-based recommender systems (ERS) for high-entropy alloys (HEAs) contains source codes in Python programming language and demo data set of the work.

# Overview

The ERS is a comprehensive independence testing projects including source code of the recommender system, testing python notebooks and small data sets to demo the implementation. These tests contain a basic example to show the commender system's usage and an example to explain the method to evaluate the recommender system using an experiment with k-folds cross-validation.

# Repo Contents

* code: ipython notebook example
* code/ers: python source code of the recommender system
* data: demo data set of the project
* output: output files contain ranking indices of HEAs in test set of each cross-validation and a figure show the distribution of the ranking indices

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

The project contains a simple version of the system deployed in standard computer. However, it requires high computation cost and is time-consuming

## Software requirements
