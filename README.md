# Evidence-based-recommender-systems
The implementation of the evidence-based recommender systems (ERS) for HEA contains source codes in Python programming language and demo data set of the work.

# Overview

The ERS is a comprehensive independence testing projects including source code of the recommender system, testing python notebooks and small data sets to demo the implementation. These test contains a basic example to show the usage of the recommender system and a example to explain the method to evaluate the recommender system using experiment with k-folds cross-validation.

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

The project contains a simple version of the system deployed in standard computer. However, it requires high computation cost and is time-consuming

## Software requirements

### OS Requirements

This package is supported for macOS and Linux. The package has been tested on the following systems:

macOS: Mojave (10.14.1)
Linux: CentOS 7

### Python Dependencies

ers mainly depends on the Python scientific stack
